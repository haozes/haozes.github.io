iOS 17 is here. 
The biggest selling point of this year’s iPhone 15 is the different Type-C interface. 😁   
We more concerned about Apple’s updates on the iOS system.


## The display on the iPad is really big.
YaoYao’s fitness data is stored in Apple’s HealthKit, which has the advantages of being more private and secure (of course, if it gets lost, I can blame Apple). The downside is that there has never been an Apple Health App on the iPad before, so YaoYao couldn’t be used on the iPad. I gave feedback to Apple before, and surprisingly, my wish came true this year on iOS 17! Apple 👍


Although the iPad still doesn’t support connecting to a Apple Watch, which means the combination of a Apple Watch and an iPad still doesn’t work, I may need to continue making wishes. Apple 👎 But now you can use AirPods with the iPad, the screen is big enough, and you can watch shows while jumping.

## Control workouts right from the lock screen.
On iOS 17, after starting a workout on the smartwatch, YaoYao will automatically display the Active Island and real-time activity on the phone. You can also tap “pause/stop” on the real-time activity to control your training. Apple 👍

### Standby Display
 If the phone is being charged while working out, YaoYao will utilize the iOS 17 Standby feature to display information.

I really like this Standby feature from Apple, making the most out of iPhone. It’s like how the watch displays the time when charging, very natural and considerate. Apple 👍

## SmartStack on watchOS
In watchOS 10, a new feature was introduced where you can swipe up from the bottom of the watch face to display SmartStack, similar to the previous Siri watch face. Previously, there were only limited slots for complicated functions on the watch face, but now you can add more on this. YaoYao also supports displaying on this, something like this:

However, I personally prefer to have different apps on different watch faces and solve this problem by switching watch faces. But now, switching watch faces requires a long press, which is less convenient than before. Apple 👎


### Go update to iOS 17 and the app!
